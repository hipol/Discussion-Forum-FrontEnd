      "info": "Some argue that food trucks should not be allowed in London Ontario, bbecause London Ontario is the home of a vibrant restaurant culture. The presence of food trucks would disturb this pre-existing delicate ecosystem that is already in place. Restaurant owners who pay rent for a place in the downtown area would be negatively affected by the people in the space. This is not good. However, when you do allow food trucks, this might attract more people to come to the downtown area, because food trucks offer more variety. The presence of food trucks also mean that people who do not have the initial capital to afford to buy a restaurant can start off their business in their way.",
